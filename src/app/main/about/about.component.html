        <p>Globally, the last two decades has revealed an increased pattern of intense global temperature with accelerating climate consequences in global south especially Sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria as a sub-Saharan nation has also seen its share of escalating environmental and health-related sufferings with increased flooding, vegetation loss, drought, food insecurity, and migration, health disorders, loss of human and animal lives, destruction of properties.</p>
        <p>Consequently, these ecosocial challenges, among others, comes with associated knowledge-collaboration gap. This gap has stimulated the formation of NCEHR, as an intervention that would link academia and community researchers from affected groups to partner together, to find out, and to achieve sustaining solutions towards a changing complex climatic event that threatens health, health equity and wellbeing for individuals, families, communities, nation and the global society at large.</p>
        <p>Nigeria Coalition for Eco-Social Health Research (NCEHR) group, a transformative grassroot innovation, is a Nigerian based inter-disciplinary and inter university collaboration that monitors the link between health and climate change through indicators highlighting the threats to health and proffering solutions with community members as co-partners, co-learners, and co-owners of knowledge produced from the group. NCEHR knows that for any effective societal impact on complex, wicked, and intractable issues are tackled with greater involvement of people affected by the health issues.</p>
        <p>NCEHR is an anchor to bridge this gap and even more driven by the intense need to stimulate and foster allied partnership, advocacy, inclusiveness for a sustainable, equitably, and beneficial environment to justly impact the health of all. NCEHR, as a sub-Saharan African-based, Nigerian-led research initiative was initiated by Dr Ngozi Joe-Ikechebelu in August 2018. With the strong support of Prof Greg Nwakoby, the Vice Chancellor of Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University (COOU), at its first launch, 7 members were co-opted for its meeting. Presently, it has over 30 members from the two Nigerian universities based in Anambra State (Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University and Nnamdi Azikiwe University (NAU)), and communities affected ecosocial issues to strengthen its research and knowledge capacity. It has potential to link up with other Anchor institutions such as teaching hospitals.</p>
        <p>NCEHR is poised to foster greater collaboration/partnership with other local, regional, and international organizations in moving the global health research agenda forward. Since inception, NCEHR collaborates with Institute for Global Solutions in Clairemont high School, Victoria, British Columbia Coalition Institute (BCCI), Nigeria Working group for Canadian Coalition for global health research (NWG-CCGHR). The latter two are offshoots of the umbrella organization, Canadian Coalition for Global Health Research (CCGHR).
